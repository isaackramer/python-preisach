# Python implementation of the Preisach model of hysteresis

This GitHub repository contains code that can be used to execute the Preisach model of hysteresis. The interactive notebooks featured here were produced for the published article [Hysteresis in soil hydraulic conductivity as driven by salinity and sodicity – a modeling framework](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/25/1993/2021/). 
The corresponding GitHub repository for that project can be found [here](https://github.com/isaackramer/soil-hysteresis).

This repository contains:

  * Widgets designed to give users an intuitive sense of how the Preisach framework works.
  * Basic implementation of the Preisach framework using Python.

## Widgets

##### 1. Geometric Intepretation of the Preisach Framework

This widget demonstrates how hysterons, the core of the Preisach framework, are used to model hysteresis. To run the widget, click the <em>Launch Binder</em>. Wait for the notebook to load (this can take several minutes) and then click <em>Cell → Run All</em>.

##### 2. The Weight Function

In this widget we demonstrate how weight functions affect the system's output. With this widget, the user can compare different weight functions, including how each affects output. To run the widget, click the <em>Launch Binder</em>. Wait for the notebook to load (this can take several minutes) and then click <em>Cell → Run All</em>.
